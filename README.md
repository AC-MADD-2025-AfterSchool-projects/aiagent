# aiagent

## idea

Personal AI Agent, personal assistant for your life, learning and work.  

## functions

The most boring and repeatable works you would like the assistant to do:  

1. Chat with owner like the chatGPT, can remember the context and all the history topics, can remember what you like and what tools you are using.(Working on)
2. Personal time management, calender management, such as MADD course assignments reminder...
3. (TBD)


## tech stack
mobile - React Native (maybe later since I have not learn that part yet)
frontend - vite, react, typescript
backend - Node.js, Express.js, Prisma & MongoDB
LLM - Ollama API
Maybe need Message Queue later for avoid backend arch tight coupling since some of the LLM will response slow.
